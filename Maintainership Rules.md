# Maintainership Rules for ZenX-OS

This set of rules are required to be considered before applying for maintainership for ZenX-OS. Please, take the time to read them before applying to form.

### Device trees

- **All the trees should be posted and public on Github/Gitlab.** At the time of applying, we compare them with different other repos from other developers/projects to check if things like authorship and commit history are made right.
- **Respect authorship and make your forks.** Having your custom device tree guarantees that if something is broken, you can fix it fast. So, it's better if you do your forks with the whole adapting to our ROM instead of linking us some Lineage/Other developer trees (the only exception to this rule is kernel/vendor trees which don't require big changes) that you used to build. Also, sources without proper commit authorship or "Initial commit" will be completely ignored.
- **Sources should not have more than 2 branches with other Custom ROM projects.** As we like to have people building and sharing the great work of other projects, we need dedicated people who might want to test some new things or check if everything is allright, not buildbots who are constantly making 100 builds for the sake of a developer title.
- **Professional approach:** We take our work serious as we are responsible for bringing users the best experience so good knowledge of Git is necessary as well as good commit description. Always be sure you're sharing almost bugless build to tester as well as users.
